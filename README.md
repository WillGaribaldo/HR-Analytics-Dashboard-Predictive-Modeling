## üß± Project Components

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Source**: HR dataset (`HR_Data.xlsx`)
- **Cleaning**:
  - Removed duplicates and null values
  - Standardized column formats and renamed fields
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created salary range buckets

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed attrition patterns across:
  - Departments
  - Job roles
  - Salary ranges
  - Tenure
- Identified trends in age and salary affecting retention

### 3. Predictive Modeling (Python)

- **Notebook**: `HR Predictive Model.ipynb`
- **Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy Score
  - ROC-AUC Curve
- **Output**:
  - Risk score of attrition per employee
  - Results exported and integrated into Power BI dashboard

### 4. Power BI Dashboard

- **Tool**: Power BI Desktop (`HR Analytics Dashboard.pbix`)
- **Layout Overview**:
  - **Top KPIs**:
    - Total Employees
    - Attrition %
    - Average Age
    - Average Monthly Salary
    - Average Years at Company
  - **Visuals**:
    - Matrix: Attrition by Department & Job Level
    - Bar Chart: Attrition by Years at Company
    - Pie Chart: Attrition by Salary Range
    - Bar Chart: Attrition by Job Role
  - **Filters/Slicers**:
    - Department, Job Level, Education
  - **Employee Table**:
    - `EMPID` and predicted attrition risk score
